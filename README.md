Musicociel song formats
===

This repository contains a JavaScript library (actually written in typescript) allowing to import/export songs between the Musicociel file format and other formats including Opensong and ChordPro.

To install it in your project, you can use yarn:

```
yarn add @musicociel/song-formats
```

Or if you prefer npm:

```
npm install @musicociel/song-formats
```

This is a work in progress. More documentation will be added later.
